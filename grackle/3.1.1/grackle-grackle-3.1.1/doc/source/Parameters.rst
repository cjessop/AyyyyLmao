Parameters
----------

For all on/off integer flags, 0 is off and 1 is on.

.. c:var:: int use_grackle

   Flag to activate the grackle machinery.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int with_radiative_cooling

   Flag to include radiative cooling and actually update the thermal
   energy during the chemistry solver.  If off, the chemistry species
   will still be updated.  The most common reason to set this to off
   is to iterate the chemistry network to an equilibrium state.
   Default: 1.

.. c:var:: int primordial_chemistry

   Flag to control which primordial chemistry network is used.
   Default: 0.

    - 0: no chemistry network.  Radiative cooling for primordial
      species is solved by interpolating from lookup tables
      calculated with Cloudy.
    - 1: 6-species atomic H and He.  Active species: H, H\ :sup:`+`,
      He, He\ :sup:`+`, \ :sup:`++`, e\ :sup:`-`.
    - 2: 9-species network including atomic species above and species
      for molecular hydrogen formation.  This network includes
      formation from the H\ :sup:`-` and H\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`+`
      channels, three-body formation (H+H+H and H+H+H\ :sub:`2`),
      H\ :sub:`2` rotational transitions, chemical heating, and
      collision-induced emission (optional).  Active species: above +
      H\ :sup:`-`, H\ :sub:`2`, H\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`+`.
    - 3: 12-species network include all above plus HD rotation cooling.
      Active species: above + D, D\ :sup:`+`, HD.

   The first five options are discussed in `Turk et. al. (2011)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...726...55T>`_.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int cie_cooling

   If :c:data:`photoelectric_heating` is enabled, the heating rate in
   units of (erg cm\ :sup:`-3` s\ :sup:`-1`) n\ :sup:`-1`\, where n is
   the total hydrogen number density. In other words, this is the
   volumetric heating rate at a hydrogen number density of

   radiation field in units of 10\ :sup:`-21` erg s\ :sup:`-1` cm\

   absorption (giving a sawtooth pattern), taken from `Haiman & Abel,
   & Rees (2000) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...534...11H>`_.
   Default: 0.

.. c:var:: float HydrogenFractionByMass

   The fraction by mass of Hydrogen in the metal-free portion of the
   gas (i.e., just the H and He). In the non-equilibrium solver, this is
   used to ensure consistency in the densities of the individual species.
   In tabulated mode, this is used to calculate the H number density from
   the total gas density, which is a parameter of the heating/cooling tables.
   When using the non-equilibrium solver, a sensible default is 0.76.
   However, the tables for tabulated mode were created assuming
   n\ :sub:`He`/n\ :sub:`H` = 0.1, which corresponds to an H mass fraction of
   about 0.716. When running in tabulated mode, this parameter will automatically
   be changed to this value. Default: 0.76.

.. c:var:: float DeuteriumToHydrogenRatio

   The ratio by mass of Deuterium to Hydrogen. Default: 6.8e-5 (the value
   from `Burles & Tytler (1998)
   <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...507..732B/abstract>`_
   multiplied by 2 for the mass of Deuterium).

.. c:var:: float SolarMetalFractionByMass

   The fraction of total gas mass in metals for a solar composition.
   Default: 0.01295 (consistent with the default abundances in the Cloudy code).

.. c:var:: int use_volumetric_heating_rate

   Flag to signal that an array of volumetric heating rates is being
   provided in the :c:data:`volumetric_heating_rate` field of the
   :c:data:`grackle_field_data` struct.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int use_specific_heating_rate

   Flag to signal that an array of specific heating rates is being
   provided in the :c:data:`specific_heating_rate` field of the
   :c:data:`grackle_field_data` struct.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int use_radiative_transfer

   Flag to signal that arrays of ionization and heating rates from
   radiative transfer solutions are being provided. Only
   available if :c:data:`primordial_chemistry` is greater than 0. HI, HeI,
   and HeII ionization arrays are provided in :c:data:`RT_HI_ionization_rate`,
   :c:data:`RT_HeI_ionization_rate`, and :c:data:`RT_HeII_ionization_rate`
   fields, respectively, of the :c:data:`grackle_field_data` struct.
   Associated heating rate is provided in the :c:data:`RT_heating_rate`
   field, and H\ :sub:`2`\ photodissociation rate can also be provided in the
   :c:data:`RT_H2_dissociation_rate` field when
   :c:data:`primordial_chemistry` is set to either 2 or 3. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int radiative_transfer_coupled_rate_solver

   When used with :c:data:`use_radiative_transfer` set to 1, this flag
   makes it possible to solve the chemistry and cooling of the
   computational elements for which the radiation field is non-zero
   separately from those with no incident radiation. This allows radiation
   transfer calculations to be performed on a smaller timestep than the
   global timestep. The parameter,
   :c:data:`radiative_transfer_intermediate_step`, is then used to toggle
   between updating the cells/particles receiving radiative input and those
   that are not. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int radiative_transfer_intermediate_step

   Used in conjunction with :c:data:`radiative_transfer_coupled_rate_solver`
   set to 1, setting this parameter to 1 tells the solver to only update
   cells/particles where the radiation field is non-zero. Setting this
   to 0 updates only those elements with no incident radiation. When
   :c:data:`radiative_transfer_coupled_rate_solver` is set to 0, changing
   this parameter will have no effect. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int radiative_transfer_hydrogen_only

   Flag to only use hydrogen ionization and heating rates from the 
   radiative transfer solutions. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int H2_self_shielding

   Switch to enable approximate H\ :sub:`2`\  self-shielding from both the UV
   background dissociation rate and the H\ :sub:`2`\  dissociation rate
   given by :c:data:`RT_H2_dissociation_rate` (if present).  Three options
   exist for the length scale used in calculating the H\ :sub:`2`\  column
   density. Default: 0.

    - 1: Use a Sobolev-like, spherically averaged method from
      `Wolcott-Green et. al. 2011 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.418..838W>`_.
      This option is only valid for Cartesian grid codes in 3D.
    - 2: Supply an array of lengths using the :c:data:`H2_self_shielding_length`
      field.
    - 3: Use the local Jeans length.

.. c:var:: int self_shielding_method

   Switch to enable approximate self-shielding from the UV background.
   All three of the below methods incorporate Eq. 13 and 14 from 
   `Rahmati et. al. 2013 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.430.2427R>`_.
   These equations involve using the spectrum averaged photoabsorption cross
   for the given species (HI or HeI). These redshift dependent values are
   pre-computed for the HM2012 and FG2011 UV backgrounds and included in
   their respective cooling data tables. Default: 0

   Care is advised in using any of these methods. The default behavior is to
   apply no self-shielding, but this is not necessarily the proper assumption,
   depending on the use case. If the user desires to turn on self-shielding,
   we strongly advise using option 3. All options include HI self-shielding, and
   vary only in treatment of HeI and HeII. In options 2 and 3, we approximately
   account for HeI self-shielding by applying the Rahmati et. al. 2013 relations,
   which are only strictly valid for HI, to HeI under the assumption that it behaves 
   similarly to HI. None of these options are completely correct in practice,
   but option 3 has produced the most reasonable results
   in test simulations. Repeating the analysis of Rahmati et. al. 2013 to
   directly parameterize HeI and HeII self-shielding behavior would be a valuable
   avenue of future research in developing a more complete self-shielding model.
   Each self-shielding option is described below.

     - 0: No self shielding. Elements are optically thin to the UV background.
     - 1: Not Recommended. Approximate self-shielding in HI only. 
          HeI and HeII are left as optically thin.
     - 2: Approximate self-shielding in both HI and HeI. HeII remains
          optically thin.
     - 3: Approximate self-shielding in both HI and HeI, but ignoring
          HeII ionization and heating from the UV background entirely
          (HeII ionization and heating rates are set to zero). 

   These methods only work in conjunction with using updated Cloudy
   cooling tables, denoted with "_shielding". These tables properly account
   for the decrease in metal line cooling rates in self-shielded regions,
   which can be significant. 

   For consistency, when ``primordial_chemistry > 2``, the self-shielding
   attenutation factors calculated for HI and HeI are applied to the 
   H\ :sub:`2`\ ionization (15.4 eV) and H\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`+` dissociation
   rates (30 eV) respectively. These reaction rates are distinct from the
   H\ :sub:`2`\ self-shielding computed using the ``H2_self_shielding``
   flag.

.. c:var:: int omp_nthreads

   Sets the number of OpenMP threads.  If not set, this will be set to
   the maximum number of threads possible, as determined by the system
   or as configured by setting the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environment
   variable.  Note, Grackle must be compiled with OpenMP support
   enabled.  See :ref:`openmp`.

Data Files
----------

All data files are located in the **input** directory in the source.

The first three files contain the heating and cooling rates for both
primordial and metal species as well as the UV background photo-heating
and photo-ionization rates.  For all three files, the valid density and
temperature range is given below.  Extrapolation is performed when
outside of the data range.  The metal cooling rates are stored for
solar metallicity and scaled linearly with the metallicity of the gas.

Valid range:

 - number density: -10 < log\ :sub:`10` (n\ :sub:`H` / cm\ :sup:`-3`) < 4

 - temperature: the temperature range is 1 < log\ :sub:`10` (T / K) < 9.

Data files:

 - **CloudyData_noUVB.h5** - cooling rates for collisional ionization
   equilibrium.

 - **CloudyData_UVB=FG2011.h5** - heating and cooling rates and UV
   background rates from the work of `Faucher-Giguere et. al. (2009)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...703.1416F>`_, updated in 2011.
   The maxmimum redshift is 10.6.  Above that, collisional ionization
   equilibrium is assumed.

 - **CloudyData_UVB=HM2012.h5** - heating and cooling rates and UV
   background rates from the work of `Haardt & Madau (2012)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...746..125H>`_.  The maximum
   redshift is 15.13.  Above that, collisional ionization equilibrium is
   assumed.

To use the self-shielding approximation (see ``self_shielding_method``),
one must properly account for the change in metal line cooling rates in
self-shielded regions. Using the optically thin tables described above can
result in an order of magnitude overestimation in the net cooling rate at
certain densities. We have re-computed these tables by constructing
Jeans-length depth models in Cloudy at each density - temperature pair, 
tabulating the cooling and heating rates from the core of each of these
clouds. These models enforce a maximum depth of 100 pc.
In addition, these tables contain the spectrum averaged absorption
cross sections needed for the Rahmati et. al. 2013 self-shielding 
approximations. Currently only the HM2012 table has been recomputed. 

 - **CloudyData_UVB=HM2012_shielded.h5** - updated heating and cooling
   rates with the HM2012 UV background, accounting for self-shielding.

 - **CloudyData_UVB=FG2011_shielded.h5** - updated heating and cooling
   rates with the FG2011 UV background, accounting for self-shielding.

The final file includes only metal cooling rates under collisional
ionization equilibrium, i.e., no incident radiation field.  This table
extends to higher densities and also varies in metallicity rather than
scaling proportional to the solar value.  This captures the
thermalization of metal coolants occuring at high densities, making this
table more appropriate for simulations of collapsing gas-clouds.

Valid range:

 - number density: -6 < log\ :sub:`10` (n\ :sub:`H` / cm\ :sup:`-3`) < 12

 - metallicity: -6 < log\ :sub:`10` (Z / Z\ :sub:`sun`) < 1

 - temperature: the temperature range is 1 < log\ :sub:`10` (T / K) < 8.

Data file:

 - **cloudy_metals_2008_3D.h5** - collisional ionization equilibrium,
   metal cooling rates only.
